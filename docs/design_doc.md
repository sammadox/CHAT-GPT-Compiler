CHAT GPT Compiler Design Document
Overview
The CHAT GPT Compiler is a compiler for CHAT GPT, a natural language programming language designed to be more accessible to non-programmers than traditional programming languages. The compiler converts CHAT GPT code into executable machine code that can be run on a computer.

The CHAT GPT Compiler is implemented in Python, and consists of several modules:

lexer.py: A lexical analyzer that scans the input source code and generates tokens that can be parsed by the compiler.
parser.py: A parser that reads the tokens generated by the lexer and generates an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure of the input program.
code_generator.py: A code generator that takes the AST generated by the parser and generates executable machine code.
Lexer
The lexer.py module defines a Lexer class that implements a lexical analyzer for CHAT GPT code. The lexer scans the input source code and generates tokens that represent the individual elements of the code, such as keywords, identifiers, and literals.

The Lexer class has a single public method, tokenize(), which returns a list of Token objects representing the tokens in the input code. The Token class has two attributes: type and value, which represent the type and value of the token, respectively.

Parser
The parser.py module defines a Parser class that implements a parser for CHAT GPT code. The parser reads the tokens generated by the lexer and generates an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure of the input program.

The Parser class has a single public method, parse(), which returns an ASTNode object representing the root of the AST. The ASTNode class is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all nodes in the AST.

The parser.py module defines several concrete subclasses of ASTNode that represent different kinds of nodes in the AST, such as NumberNode, UnaryOpNode, and BinOpNode. These subclasses are used to build up the AST as the parser processes the input code.

Code Generator
The code_generator.py module defines a CodeGenerator class that implements a code generator for CHAT GPT code. The code generator takes the AST generated by the parser and generates executable machine code.

The CodeGenerator class has a single public method, generate_code(), which takes an ASTNode object representing the root of the AST and returns a string containing the machine code generated from the AST.

Conclusion
The CHAT GPT Compiler is a simple compiler for a simple programming language. It demonstrates how a compiler can be built using Python and a few simple techniques, such as lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.

Future versions of the CHAT GPT Compiler could include additional features, such as support for more complex language constructs, error handling, and optimization.

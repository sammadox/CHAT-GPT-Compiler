CHAT GPT Compiler User Manual
Introduction
The CHAT GPT Compiler is a natural language programming language designed to be more accessible to non-programmers than traditional programming languages. It is a compiler that converts CHAT GPT code into executable machine code that can be run on a computer.

Getting Started
To use the CHAT GPT Compiler, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Once you have Python installed, you can download the source code for the CHAT GPT Compiler from the GitHub repository. After downloading the source code, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Using the Compiler
To use the CHAT GPT Compiler, you will need to write CHAT GPT code in a text editor and save it as a file with a .chat extension. Once you have written your CHAT GPT code, you can compile it by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

python compiler.py your_file_name.chat

Replace your_file_name.chat with the name of the file that contains your CHAT GPT code. The compiler will generate an executable file with the same name as your input file, but with a .exe extension.

Example Code
Here is an example of a simple CHAT GPT program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console:

say "Hello, world!"

Save this code to a file with a .chat extension, then run the compiler as described above to generate an executable file that will print "Hello, world!" to the console when executed.

Conclusion
The CHAT GPT Compiler is a simple and accessible programming language that can be used by non-programmers to create executable programs. With a basic understanding of the syntax and structure of CHAT GPT code, anyone can write and compile their own programs.

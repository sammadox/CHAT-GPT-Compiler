CHAT GPT Compiler
This is a compiler for CHAT GPT, a natural language programming language designed to be more accessible to non-programmers than traditional programming languages. The compiler converts CHAT GPT code into executable machine code that can be run on a computer.

Features
Lexer: A lexical analyzer that scans the input source code and generates tokens that can be parsed by the compiler.
Parser: A parser that reads the tokens generated by the lexer and generates an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure of the input program.
Code generator: A code generator that takes the AST generated by the parser and generates executable machine code.
Getting started
To use the CHAT GPT compiler, you'll need to have a copy of the source code and a C compiler installed on your system. Once you have those, you can compile the compiler by running the make command in the root directory of the project. Once the compiler is compiled, you can run it on a CHAT GPT source file by running ./compiler <filename>.
